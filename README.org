* TODO
  Figure out the proper way to format org mode files to look pretty on Github

* Identify each person in the frame
** Correlate them to previous frames
** Identify the poses / hand placement of each person (where is each extremity?)
** Guess what move is being attempted / in process of being attempted based on the position of each person

Current Research:
* Motion Tracking / Human Action Classification
** http://crcv.ucf.edu/data/UCF50.php
   UCF50 is an action recognition data set with 50 action categories, consisting of realistic videos taken from youtube. This data set is an extension of YouTube Action data set (UCF11) which has 11 action categories.
*** TODO Further research
    Template based methods [1], modeling the dy- namics of human motion using finite state models [6] or hidden Markov models [21], and Bag of Features models [10, 4, 11, 22] (BOF)
